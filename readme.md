## Overview

**Project Title**: Car Maintenance WebApp

**Project Description**: A web app that stores the information on the latest maintenance you had done on your vehicle and when services are needed again

**Project Goals**: To learn django and how to have an app work with a database

**Demo Video**: [YouTube](https://youtu.be/DMI5R1FSOjk)

## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. Download all of the files from the github
2. Open the directory and in console run "python manage.py runserver"
3. Open the adress which the server opened at which is a default of http://127.0.0.1:8000/

Instructions for using the software:

1. Navigate to either the sign in or sign up page(currently both work the same)
2. Navigate to the Add new vehicle page
3. Import the information on the last time any service has been done to your vehicle
4. This is currently the limit of the software but in the future will allow for more vehicles to be added and
   will tell you when services need to be done again

## Development Environment 

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:
